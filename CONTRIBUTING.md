## Contribution Guidelines

### Any PRs are welcome
Spot a typo? Send a pull request! Use of mutable values at the wrong places? Send a pull request!

Basically, if you have something to contribute, we'll be more than happy to merge it if it fits the goals for the app.

### Making Changes
This is **important**. So read this part carefully.

If you're writing something that introduces a new design or requires the modification of the existing user interface, please create an issue with the `design` tag and discuss your proposed changes before writing any code. Even if design is not your forte, raising that issue can give someone else the opportunity to contribute a design. This is to help maintain and regulate a high standard of user experience in the app.

_Note: the .sketch file will soon be made available once the app has been finalised and released on the App Store_

### Bug Reports
Guidelines for bug reports:

1. Check Github Issues - see if bug has already been reported
2. Check if issue is fixed - attempt to reproduce with latest `master`
3. Identify if your issue relates to one of the following: Design/Frontend or Bug
4. Use the bug report template below and create a new issue

### Feature Requests
Before you submit be sure to do the following:

1. Search existing issues for similar requests and comment on that one instead of creating a new issue
2. Take a moment and think if the feature fits the scope of the application and such feature will positively benefit a user's conference-going experience
3. Provide as much detail and context and possible with a few use cases that will help make your feature request more _convincing_
